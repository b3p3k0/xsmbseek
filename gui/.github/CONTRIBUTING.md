## Documentation Standards

- **Document as you code** - Update DEVNOTES.md during each session
- **Complete docstrings** for all functions and classes
- **Architecture decisions** must be documented with reasoning
- **Testing results** must be recorded in DEVNOTES.md

## Testing Requirements

- All GUI components must have corresponding tests
- Test with mock data before live backend integration
- Cross-platform testing required for contributions

## Pull Request Process

1. Update DEVNOTES.md with development session notes
2. Ensure all tests pass with `pytest tests/`
3. Update USER_GUIDE.md for user-facing changes
4. Add changelog entry to CHANGELOG.md

## Code Standards
