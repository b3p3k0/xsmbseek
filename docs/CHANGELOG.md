# SMBSeek GUI Changelog

All notable changes to the SMBSeek GUI project will be documented in this file.

## [1.2.1] - 2025-11-08

### Added
- **Scan Templates**: Start New Scan dialog now includes a Templates toolbar so you can save/load per-scan parameter sets (search strings, regions, filters, execution tuning) without touching the global SMBSeek config file.
  - Ships with six curated presets (stored under `templates/default_scan_templates/`) seeded from secybr’s public Shodan dork tutorials to showcase real-world use cases on first launch.
- **Server List Probe Column**: The server list now shows a 🧪 status indicator (○ = unprobed, △ = probed, ✖ reserved) next to the favorite/avoid columns so analysts can immediately see which hosts have snapshots.
- **Server Detail Probe**: Added a Probe dialog to the Server Details view. It lets analysts adjust limits, enumerate a bounded number of directories/files per accessible share using the original anonymous credentials, caches the result under `~/.smbseek/probes/`, and renders an ASCII tree inside the details view. Requires the `impacket` library.
- **Probe Indicator Matching**: GUI now loads `security.ransomware_indicators` from the SMBSeek backend config and marks any host whose probe results include those filenames with a ✖ glyph plus a detail-view alert listing the hits.

### Changed
- **Scan Dialog Layout Refresh**: Start New Scan dialog now opens at 1210x825 with a responsive two-column layout that splits targeting controls (search strings, country, regions, filters) on the left and execution controls (rescan, concurrency, rate limits, API key) on the right for greatly reduced scrolling.
- **Button Placement**: Cancel and Start buttons are grouped on the lower-right with shared spacing for a consistent call-to-action row.
- **Input Focus Flow**: Search Strings field now receives initial keyboard focus to match its new prominence at the top of the dialog.
- **Server Detail Layout**: Removed the legacy "Security Assessment" block and now render probe snapshots directly beneath the Share Access section for better readability.

### Fixed
- **Country Input Padding**: Country Code card uses the same horizontal padding as neighboring sections, eliminating the subtle width mismatch reported in UI review.

### Removed
- **Legacy Profile Manager Dialog**: The dashboard Profiles button and its file-based save/load workflow have been retired in favor of in-dialog scan templates.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-09-05

### Changed
- **Dashboard Interface Reorganization**: Complete redesign of main dashboard for compact, efficient layout
  - Removed unused metric cards: "Available Shares", "High Risk Vulnerabilities", "Recent Discoveries"
  - Removed entire country breakdown section for cleaner interface
  - Implemented horizontal layout with "Total Servers" card and expanded "Recent Activity" section
  - Optimized card proportions and button alignment for professional appearance

### Fixed
- **Critical Window Height Issue**: Resolved persistent 750px window height problem that ignored settings
  - Root cause: `update_idletasks()` calls triggered tkinter's automatic content-based window resizing
  - Solution: Replaced with safer `update()` calls and added window size enforcement mechanism
  - Dashboard now correctly maintains intended 350px height for compact layout
  - Added protective callbacks to prevent auto-resizing after UI operations

### Added
- **Window Size Protection**: New enforcement mechanism prevents unwanted window resizing
  - Size enforcement callbacks ensure window dimensions remain as intended
  - Multiple protection layers during data refresh and progress updates
  - Preserves window position while enforcing target dimensions

### Technical
- **Enhanced Progress Updates**: Improved UI update mechanism without geometry recalculation
- **Settings Migration**: Automatic migration of legacy window geometry settings
- **Defensive Programming**: Added error handling for UI destruction scenarios during updates

## [1.0.1] - 2025-08-23

### Removed
- **Top Findings Section**: Removed "TOP FINDINGS" section from main dashboard for cleaner interface
- **Auto-refresh Functionality**: Disabled automatic screen refresh (5-second intervals) to reduce distraction
  - Manual refresh still available via F5 key or explicit user action
  - Eliminates unnecessary network/database polling

### Fixed  
- **Configuration Editor Error**: Fixed tkinter Label parameter conflict causing "multiple values for keyword argument 'fg'" error
  - Root cause: Parameter collision in style.py create_styled_label() method
  - Solution: Use kwargs.pop() to handle fg parameter extraction

### Changed
- **Configuration Editor Interface**: Completely redesigned as simple text editor
  - Replaced complex dual-mode interface with straightforward text editing
  - Added Open, Save, Cancel buttons with clear functionality
  - Save button validates JSON syntax and closes window on success

  - Removed "TOP FINDINGS" section for cleaner interface
  - Manual refresh still available via F5 key for user control

- **UI Window Sizing**: Improved default window sizes for better element visibility
  - Main window now defaults to 800x600 (matches minimum size for optimal layout)
  - Configuration editor increased to 800x700 (from 800x600) for proper button panel spacing
  - Conservative sizing approach ensures all UI elements visible by default while maintaining responsiveness

- **Scan Dialog Space Optimization**: Enhanced scan dialog layout for maximum screen real estate efficiency
  - Dialog height optimized to 500x460 (from 500x400) for proper element visibility
  - Reduced padding throughout interface: header (20px→15px), sections (15px→10px), containers (15px→10px)
  - Button panel spacing optimized (20px→15px bottom margin) while maintaining accessibility
  - Hybrid approach combines height increase (+60px) with padding efficiency (~40px saved)
  - Result: ~100px additional usable space ensuring all UI elements are clearly visible

- **Metric Card Click Handler Fix**: Resolved UI error caused by conflicting click zones in dashboard metric cards
  - Removed redundant click handlers from card containers that caused error dialogs when clicked
  - Preserved "View Details" button functionality which opens server list browser correctly
  - Eliminated unwanted clickable areas around buttons that triggered different (broken) dialog paths
  - Clean, predictable user interface with single click target per metric card
  - Industry standard practice: single responsibility for UI click targets

- **Server List Double-Click Fix**: Resolved blank dialog issue and implemented standard file browser UX
  - Fixed double-click on server entries to show identical content as "View Details" button
  - Replaced unreliable selection-dependent logic with direct event-based row identification
  - Implemented standard file browser paradigm: single-click selects row, double-click opens details
  - Added comprehensive error handling with appropriate user feedback messages
  - Ensured visual feedback through explicit row selection during double-click operations
  - Industry standard practice: event-coordinate-based TreeView interaction handling

- **Comprehensive Scan Progress Tracking Overhaul**: Resolved "stuck at Initializing 5%" and implemented robust real-time updates
  - **Root Cause Fixed**: Backend outputs `ℹ 📊 Progress: X/Y (Z%)` with ANSI color codes, not simple patterns
  - **Enhanced Regex Patterns**: Updated patterns to handle ANSI color codes, info prefixes, and additional context
  - **Workflow Step Detection**: Added parsing for `[1/4] Discovery & Authentication` step transitions
  - **Early-Stage Activity**: Immediate feedback for Shodan queries and database loading (within 2-3 seconds)
