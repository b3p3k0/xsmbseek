# SMBSeek GUI Changelog

All notable changes to the SMBSeek GUI project will be documented in this file.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-09-05

### Changed
- **Dashboard Interface Reorganization**: Complete redesign of main dashboard for compact, efficient layout
  - Removed unused metric cards: "Available Shares", "High Risk Vulnerabilities", "Recent Discoveries"
  - Removed entire country breakdown section for cleaner interface
  - Implemented horizontal layout with "Total Servers" card and expanded "Recent Activity" section
  - Optimized card proportions and button alignment for professional appearance

### Fixed
- **Critical Window Height Issue**: Resolved persistent 750px window height problem that ignored settings
  - Root cause: `update_idletasks()` calls triggered tkinter's automatic content-based window resizing
  - Solution: Replaced with safer `update()` calls and added window size enforcement mechanism
  - Dashboard now correctly maintains intended 350px height for compact layout
  - Added protective callbacks to prevent auto-resizing after UI operations

### Added
- **Window Size Protection**: New enforcement mechanism prevents unwanted window resizing
  - Size enforcement callbacks ensure window dimensions remain as intended
  - Multiple protection layers during data refresh and progress updates
  - Preserves window position while enforcing target dimensions

### Technical
- **Enhanced Progress Updates**: Improved UI update mechanism without geometry recalculation
- **Settings Migration**: Automatic migration of legacy window geometry settings
- **Defensive Programming**: Added error handling for UI destruction scenarios during updates

## [1.0.1] - 2025-08-23

### Removed
- **Top Findings Section**: Removed "TOP FINDINGS" section from main dashboard for cleaner interface
- **Auto-refresh Functionality**: Disabled automatic screen refresh (5-second intervals) to reduce distraction
  - Manual refresh still available via F5 key or explicit user action
  - Eliminates unnecessary network/database polling

### Fixed  
- **Configuration Editor Error**: Fixed tkinter Label parameter conflict causing "multiple values for keyword argument 'fg'" error
  - Root cause: Parameter collision in style.py create_styled_label() method
  - Solution: Use kwargs.pop() to handle fg parameter extraction

### Changed
- **Configuration Editor Interface**: Completely redesigned as simple text editor
  - Replaced complex dual-mode interface with straightforward text editing
  - Added Open, Save, Cancel buttons with clear functionality
  - Save button validates JSON syntax and closes window on success
  - Cancel button prompts for unsaved changes before closing
  - Small font file path display for reference
  - Enhanced user experience with immediate feedback on configuration changes

### Technical
- **Backend Configuration Propagation**: Ensured saved configuration changes automatically apply to subsequent backend operations
- **Error Handling**: Improved JSON validation and user feedback for configuration editing

## [1.1.0] - 2025-08-23

### Added
- **Complete Scan Management System**: Full scan workflow implementation with comprehensive UI
  - Scan configuration dialog with country selection and config editor integration
  - Real-time progress tracking with detailed "scanning host X/Y" status updates
  - Lock file coordination preventing concurrent scans (.scan_lock)
  - Comprehensive scan results dialog with success/failure/interruption handling
  
- **Enhanced Server List Browser**: Advanced date filtering and sorting capabilities
  - Date filters: "Since Last Scan", "Last 24 Hours", "Last 7 Days", "Last 30 Days"
  - Smart date field detection supporting various database schemas
  - Toggle between recent and all results with visual indicators
  - Advanced mode integration with all existing filtering options

- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Robust error management throughout application

  - Integrated access from scan dialog for seamless workflow

### Fixed
- **Dashboard Improvements**: Removed distracting auto-refresh functionality
  - Eliminated automatic screen refreshes (5-second intervals)
  - Removed "TOP FINDINGS" section for cleaner interface
  - Manual refresh still available via F5 key for user control

- **UI Window Sizing**: Improved default window sizes for better element visibility
  - Main window now defaults to 800x600 (matches minimum size for optimal layout)
  - Configuration editor increased to 800x700 (from 800x600) for proper button panel spacing
  - Conservative sizing approach ensures all UI elements visible by default while maintaining responsiveness

- **Scan Dialog Space Optimization**: Enhanced scan dialog layout for maximum screen real estate efficiency
  - Dialog height optimized to 500x460 (from 500x400) for proper element visibility
  - Reduced padding throughout interface: header (20pxâ†’15px), sections (15pxâ†’10px), containers (15pxâ†’10px)
  - Button panel spacing optimized (20pxâ†’15px bottom margin) while maintaining accessibility
  - Hybrid approach combines height increase (+60px) with padding efficiency (~40px saved)
  - Result: ~100px additional usable space ensuring all UI elements are clearly visible

- **Metric Card Click Handler Fix**: Resolved UI error caused by conflicting click zones in dashboard metric cards
  - Removed redundant click handlers from card containers that caused error dialogs when clicked
  - Preserved "View Details" button functionality which opens server list browser correctly
  - Eliminated unwanted clickable areas around buttons that triggered different (broken) dialog paths
  - Clean, predictable user interface with single click target per metric card
  - Industry standard practice: single responsibility for UI click targets

- **Server List Double-Click Fix**: Resolved blank dialog issue and implemented standard file browser UX
  - Fixed double-click on server entries to show identical content as "View Details" button
  - Replaced unreliable selection-dependent logic with direct event-based row identification
  - Implemented standard file browser paradigm: single-click selects row, double-click opens details
  - Added comprehensive error handling with appropriate user feedback messages
  - Ensured visual feedback through explicit row selection during double-click operations
  - Industry standard practice: event-coordinate-based TreeView interaction handling

- **Comprehensive Scan Progress Tracking Overhaul**: Resolved "stuck at Initializing 5%" and implemented robust real-time updates
  - **Root Cause Fixed**: Backend outputs `â„¹ ðŸ“Š Progress: X/Y (Z%)` with ANSI color codes, not simple patterns
  - **Enhanced Regex Patterns**: Updated patterns to handle ANSI color codes, info prefixes, and additional context
  - **Workflow Step Detection**: Added parsing for `[1/4] Discovery & Authentication` step transitions
  - **Early-Stage Activity**: Immediate feedback for Shodan queries and database loading (within 2-3 seconds)
  - **Progressive Mapping**: Workflow steps mapped to progress ranges (Discovery: 0-25%, Access: 25-60%, etc.)
  - **Unbuffered Output**: Fixed subprocess buffering with `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` for real-time updates
  - **Enhanced Patterns**: Added Shodan detection, database loading, authentication results tracking
  - **Fallback Mechanisms**: Time-based progress validation and forward-only percentage guarantee
  - **User Experience**: Activity indicators, phase-specific visual cues, runtime duration tracking
  - **Technical Achievement**: Comprehensive parsing alignment with actual backend output format
