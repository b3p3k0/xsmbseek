# SMB Scanner Organization Exclusion List
#
# Purpose: This file contains organization names to exclude from SMB scanning.
# These are typically ISPs, hosting providers, cloud services, and telecom companies
# that commonly have SMB services on routers/infrastructure rather than vulnerable endpoints.
#
# Format: One organization name per line, exactly as it appears in Shodan results.
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored.
# Organization names are case-sensitive and should match Shodan's format exactly.
#
# To modify this list:
# - Add new organizations by placing each on a new line
# - Use the exact organization name as shown in Shodan search results
# - Do not use quotes around organization names
# - Comments can be added with # at the beginning of a line
#
# Example Shodan org field: "org": "Comcast Cable Communications LLC"
# Exclusion entry: Comcast Cable Communications LLC
